This is my solution to the [Software Sauna Code Challenge](https://github.com/softwaresauna/code-challenge).

To run it:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run it with `npm run start`

Script contains map saved in the global constant in `src/index.ts`.

Run Jest tests with `npm run test`. All provided examples should be in the test
files.
